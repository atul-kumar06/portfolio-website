# Portfolio Website

This is my **first portfolio website**, built using **HTML and CSS**. It showcases my projects, skills, and a little about me as I begin my journey toward becoming a **Full Stack Developer**.

## ðŸ§‘ About Me

Iâ€™ve built this portfolio as my first project while learning web development. I am currently pursuing Full Stack Development and improving my skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js**. This portfolio represents my learning journey and my passion for coding.

## ðŸ’» Skills
I have a solid foundation in **HTML, CSS**, and **JavaScript**, which I use to build responsive and interactive web pages. I am learning **React.js** for front-end development and **Node.js** for backend development. I also use **Git and GitHub** for version control and project management.
